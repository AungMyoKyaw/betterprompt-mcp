Q: "Explain how photosynthesis works"
A: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's how it works:

**The Process:**
1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll in leaves captures sunlight
2. **Water Uptake**: Roots absorb water from soil
3. **Carbon Dioxide Intake**: Leaves take in CO2 from air
4. **Chemical Reaction**: 6CO2 + 6H2O +å…‰èƒ½ â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2
5. **Energy Storage**: Glucose stores the energy for later use

**Why It Matters**: This process not only feeds the plant but also produces the oxygen we breathe, making it fundamental to life on Earth."`;

Q: "Compare electric cars vs gas cars"
A: "Here's a comprehensive comparison:

**Performance:**
- Electric: Instant torque, quiet operation, smooth acceleration
- Gas: Familiar driving experience, longer range, quick refueling

**Environmental Impact:**
- Electric: Zero direct emissions, but depends on electricity source
- Gas: Direct CO2 emissions, established recycling infrastructure

**Economics:**
- Electric: Lower operating costs, higher upfront cost, tax incentives
- Gas: Lower purchase price, higher fuel and maintenance costs

**Conclusion**: Electric cars excel in efficiency and environmental benefits, while gas cars offer convenience and lower entry costs. The best choice depends on your driving patterns, budget, and environmental priorities."`;
