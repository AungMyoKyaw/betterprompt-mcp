- `role` - Expert role assignment
- `few-shot` - Example-based learning
- `tree-of-thoughts` - Multiple reasoning paths
- `react` - Reasoning and action combination
- `reflexion` - Self-reflection and improvement
- `generate-knowledge` - Background information generation
- `prompt-chaining` - Sequential task breakdown
- `self-consistency` - Multiple path consistency

- `comprehensive` - Combined techniques

### Tool 2: AI-Enhanced Prompt (`ai-enhance-prompt`)

Use AI model sampling for intelligent enhancement:

```json
{
  "name": "ai-enhance-prompt",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Analyze this data",
    "enhancement_type": "analytical",
    "max_tokens": 1000
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `prompt` (required): The original prompt to enhance
- `enhancement_type` (optional): Type of enhancement (`creative`, `analytical`, `technical`, `comprehensive`)
- `max_tokens` (optional): Maximum tokens for AI response (50-2000, default: 800)

### Tool 3: Batch Processing (`batch-enhance-prompts`)

Process multiple prompts simultaneously:

```json
{
  "name": "batch-enhance-prompts",
  "arguments": {
    "prompts": ["Write a poem", "Explain AI", "Create a business plan"],

  }
}
```

**Parameters:**

- Provide fallback to rule-based enhancement if AI sampling fails
- Support configurable token limits and enhancement types

This creates a hybrid approach combining rule-based techniques with AI-powered contextual understanding.
