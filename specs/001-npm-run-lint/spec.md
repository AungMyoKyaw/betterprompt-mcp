# Feature Specification: Lint and Auto-Fix Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `001-npm-run-lint`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "npm run lint and fix linting error"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: Should auto-fixes be automatically committed to the feature branch, or should the tooling prefer opening a PR with the suggested fixes for human review? ‚Üí A: Auto-commit safe autofixes to current branch
- Q: How should lint "warnings" be treated by local tooling and CI? ‚Üí A: Treat warnings as errors in CI (fail pipeline; require fixes)

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Developer or automation invokes the repository lint command: `npm run lint`.
2. Linter runs across all tracked source files and returns a list of linting violations.
3. For violations that are auto-fixable, run the auto-fix step (e.g. `--fix`) to correct them.
4. Re-run the linter to confirm remaining violations.
   - If no violations remain: SUCCESS ‚Äî repository is lint-clean.
   - If violations remain: produce a human-actionable report and open a PR with proposed fixes or request manual fixes depending on the rule severity.
5. Ensure CI fails the pipeline on lint errors to prevent merging lint regressions.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Purpose: Ensure the repository is lint-clean and provide a repeatable developer workflow to discover and fix lint issues.
- ‚ùå Not in scope: Redesign of lint rules themselves or adoption of a new linting engine (unless explicitly requested).
- üë• Audience: Maintainers and contributors who need clear, testable guidance for running and fixing lint issues.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a contributor, I want a single, documented command to surface lint problems and (where safe) apply automated fixes so I can keep the codebase consistent and pass CI checks.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a repository with lint errors, when a developer runs `npm run lint -- --fix`, then autofixable issues are corrected, and the command exits with success if no remaining violations.
2. Given a repository with non-autofixable lint errors, when a developer runs `npm run lint`, then the command exits non-zero and prints a clear list of files and line numbers that need manual attention.
3. Given an open pull request, when CI runs, then the job should fail if lint violations remain and provide the same human-actionable report used locally.
4. Given any lint warnings, when CI runs, then warnings MUST be treated as failures (CI job fails) and be reported the same as violations so they are fixed before merge.

### Edge Cases

- Some lint rules are intentionally enabled and require manual review (e.g., stylistic choices that cannot be auto-fixed).
- Auto-fix may reorder code (formatting) that requires human review in sensitive spots (e.g., exported API formatting).
- Linter configuration differences across developer machines: ensure CI uses a consistent Node and toolchain.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repository MUST expose a documented command that runs the linter across the codebase (e.g., `npm run lint`).
- **FR-002**: The lint command MUST be runnable in CI and fail the build on lint violations.
- **FR-003**: There MUST be an option (or documented approach) to apply auto-fixes for violations that are safe to fix automatically (e.g., `--fix`).
- **FR-004**: Lint output MUST be machine-parseable (files, line numbers, rule ids) to support automation and CI annotations.
- **FR-005**: When auto-fixes are applied, the repository MUST include guidance on how to review and commit those fixes safely. Policy: Safe autofixes MUST be auto-applied and auto-committed to the current feature branch; fixes that are behavior-affecting MUST NOT be auto-committed (definition of "behavior-affecting" remains to be clarified). Auto-committed autofix commits SHOULD use a consistent commit message prefix (e.g., `chore(lint): auto-fix`) and include a brief machine-readable summary of files changed.
- **FR-006**: If auto-fix would cause behavioral changes (beyond formatting), the system MUST NOT auto-commit such fixes without explicit human approval ‚Äî instead, present them as a patch/PR for manual review. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: define which rules are considered behavior-affecting]
- **FR-007**: Lint warnings MUST be escalated to failures in CI and cause the pipeline to fail; local tooling SHOULD surface warnings prominently and provide guidance to fix them (e.g., `--fix` where applicable).

### Key Entities \_(include if feature involves data)

- **Lint Report**: A structured artifact listing violations with fields: file, line, column, ruleId, message, fixable(bool).

## Open Questions / Clarifications

- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Which specific lint rules should be considered behavior-affecting and therefore require manual review rather than automatic committing of fixes?

---

## Acceptance Criteria (final)

- Running `npm run lint` in CI fails the build if any lint violations remain.
- Running `npm run lint -- --fix` locally fixes all autofixable issues and exits with success when no remaining violations exist.
- Maintainable guidance is documented in README or CONTRIBUTING on how to run and review lint fixes.
